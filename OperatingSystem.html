  <h1>OPerating System</h1>
  <p> Software program that interacts with the computer and user.<br/>
  Controls computer hardware, Manages system resources, supervises interaction between computer and user.<br/>
Operating system also forms a baae on which applications software is developed and executed.</p>
<h3>Functions of an Operating System</h3>
<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Command Interpretation</strong> : CPU cannot understand the commands keyedin by user,<br/>
     it is the function of the Operating system to
  to translate these commands into language that CPU can understand</p></li>
  <li><p> <strong>Perpheral Management</strong> :Operating system has to take care of the device(peripheral)<br/>
  attached to the system.Communication between these devices and the CPU is over seen by Operating System.</p>  </li>
  <li><p><strong> Memory Management</strong>: The OS handles the extremely important job of allocating memory<br/>
     for the various process running on the system.It also has to clean up after a process-i.e dispose of left-over data in memory.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Process Management</strong>: This is required if several programs hve to run at the same time.<br/>
    CPU time would then have to be rationed out by the OS to ensure that no program gets more than its fair share of CPU time.</p></li>
